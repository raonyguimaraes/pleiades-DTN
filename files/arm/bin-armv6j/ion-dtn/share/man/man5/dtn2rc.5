dtn2rc \- "dtn" scheme configuration commands file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\*(L"dtn\*(R" scheme configuration commands are passed to \fBdtn2admin\fR either in a
file of text lines or interactively at \fBdtn2admin\fR's command prompt (:).
Commands are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.
.PP
\&\*(L"dtn\*(R" scheme configuration commands mainly establish static routing rules
for forwarding bundles to \*(L"dtn\*(R"\-scheme destination endpoints, identified by
node names and demux names.
.PP
Static routes are expressed as \fBplan\fRs in the \*(L"dtn\*(R"\-scheme routing database.
A plan that is established for a given node name associates a default routing
\&\fBdirective\fR with the named node, and that default directive may be
overridden by more narrowly scoped \fBrule\fRs in specific circumstances: a
different directive may apply when the destination endpoint \s-1ID\s0 specifies
a particular demux name.
.PP
Each directive is a string of one of two possible forms:
.Sp
.RS 4
f \fIendpoint_ID\fR
.RE
.PP
\&...or...
.Sp
.RS 4
x \fIprotocol_name\fR/\fIoutduct_name\fR[,\fIdestination_induct_name\fR],
.RE
.PP
The former form signifies that the bundle is to be forwarded to the indicated
endpoint, requiring that it be re-queued for processing by the forwarder
for that endpoint (which might, but need not, be identified by another
\&\*(L"dtn\*(R"\-scheme endpoint \s-1ID\s0).  The latter form signifies that the bundle is
to be queued for transmission via the indicated convergence layer protocol
outduct.  \fIdestination_induct_name\fR must be provided when the indicated
outduct is \*(L"promiscuous\*(R", i.e., not configured for transmission only to
a single neighboring node; this is protocol-specific.
.PP
The node names and demux names cited in dtn2rc plans and overriding rules
may be \*(L"wild-carded\*(R".  That is, when the last character of a node name is
either '*' or '~' (these two wild-card characters are equivalent for this
purpose), the plan or rule applies to all nodes whose names are identical
to the wild-carded node name up to the wild-card character; wild-carded
demux names function in the same way.  For example, a bundle whose
destination \s-1EID\s0's node name is \*(L"//foghorn\*(R" would be routed by plans citing
the following node names: \*(L"//foghorn\*(R", \*(L"//fogh*\*(R", \*(L"//fog~\*(R", \*(L"//*\*(R".  When
multiple plans are all applicable to the same destination \s-1EID\s0, the one citing
the longest (i.e., most narrowly targeted) node name will be applied; when
multiple rules overriding the same plan are all applicable to the same
destination \s-1EID\s0, the one citing the longest demux name will be applied.
.PP
The formats and effects of the \s-1DTN\s0 scheme configuration commands are
described below.
.SH "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IX Header "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by dtn2admin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed.  \s-1HINT:\s0
combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fB?\fR command.
.SH "PLAN COMMANDS"
.IX Header "PLAN COMMANDS"
.IP "\fBa plan\fR \fInode_name\fR \fIdefault_directive\fR" 4
.IX Item "a plan node_name default_directive"
The \fBadd plan\fR command.  This command establishes a static route for
the bundles destined for the node identified by \fInode_name\fR.  A general
plan must be in place for a node before any more specific routing rules
are declared.
.IP "\fBd plan\fR \fInode_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "d plan node_name"
The \fBdelete plan\fR command.  This command deletes the static route for
the node identified by \fInode_name\fR, including all associated rules.
.IP "\fBi plan\fR \fInode_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "i plan node_name"
This command will print information (the default directive and all
specific rules) about the static route for the node identified by \fInode_name\fR.
.IP "\fBl plan\fR" 4
.IX Item "l plan"
This command lists all static routes established in the \s-1DTN\s0 database for
the local node.
.SH "RULE COMMANDS"
.IX Header "RULE COMMANDS"
.IP "\fBa rule\fR \fInode_name\fR \fIdemux_name\fR \fIdirective\fR" 4
.IX Item "a rule node_name demux_name directive"
The \fBadd rule\fR command.  This command establishes a rule, i.e., a
directive that overrides the default directive of the plan for the node
identified by \fInode_name\fR in the event that the demux name of the subject
bundle's destination endpoint \s-1ID\s0 matches \fIdemux_name\fR.
.IP "\fBc rule\fR \fInode_name\fR \fIdemux_name\fR \fIdirective\fR" 4
.IX Item "c rule node_name demux_name directive"
The \fBchange rule\fR command.  This command changes the directive for the
indicated rule.
.IP "\fBd rule\fR \fInode_name\fR \fIdemux_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "d rule node_name demux_name"
The \fBdelete rule\fR command.  This command deletes the rule identified
by \fInode_name\fR and \fIdemux_name\fR.
.IP "\fBi rule\fR \fInode_name\fR \fIdemux_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "i rule node_name demux_name"
This command will print information (the directive) about the rule
identified by \fInode_name\fR and \fIdemux_name\fR.
.IP "\fBl rule\fR \fInode_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "l rule node_name"
This command lists all rules in the plan for the indicated node.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
.IP "a plan //bbn2 f ipn:8.41" 4
.IX Item "a plan //bbn2 f ipn:8.41"
Declares a static route from the local node to node \*(L"//bbn2\*(R".  By default, any
bundle destined for any endpoint whose node name is \*(L"//bbn2\*(R" will be forwarded
to endpoint \*(L"ipn:8.41\*(R".
.IP "a plan //mitre1 x ltp/6" 4
.IX Item "a plan //mitre1 x ltp/6"
Declares a static route from the local node to node \*(L"//mitre1\*(R".  By default,
any bundle destined for any endpoint whose node name is \*(L"mitre1\*(R" will
be queued for transmission on \s-1LTP\s0 outduct 6.
.IP "a rule //mitre1 fwd x ltp/18" 4
.IX Item "a rule //mitre1 fwd x ltp/18"
Declares an overriding static routing rule for any bundle destined for node
\&\*(L"//mitre1\*(R" whose destination demux name is \*(L"fwd\*(R".  Each such bundle must be
queued for transmission on \s-1LTP\s0 outduct 18 rather than the default (\s-1LTP\s0
outduct 6).
