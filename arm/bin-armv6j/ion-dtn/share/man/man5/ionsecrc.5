ionsecrc \- ION security policy management commands file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1ION\s0 security policy management commands are passed to \fBionsecadmin\fR either
in a file of text lines or interactively at \fBionsecadmin\fR's command prompt
(:).  Commands are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per
line.  The formats and effects of the \s-1ION\s0 security policy management commands
are described below.
.PP
A parameter identifed as an \fIeid_expr\fR is an \*(L"endpoint \s-1ID\s0 expression.\*(R"  For
all commands, whenever the last character of an endpoint \s-1ID\s0 expression is
the wild-card character '*', an applicable endpoint \s-1ID\s0 \*(L"matches\*(R" this \s-1EID\s0
expression if all characters of the endpoint \s-1ID\s0 expression prior to the last
one are equal to the corresponding characters of that endpoint \s-1ID\s0.  Otherwise
an applicable endpoint \s-1ID\s0 \*(L"matches\*(R" the \s-1EID\s0 expression only when all characters
of the \s-1EID\s0 and \s-1EID\s0 expression are identical.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by ionsecadmin to
be logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed.  \s-1HINT:\s0
combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.
.IP "\fB1\fR" 4
.IX Item "1"
The \fBinitialize\fR command.  Until this command is executed, the local \s-1ION\s0
node has no security policy database and most \fIionsecadmin\fR commands will fail.
.IP "\fBa key\fR \fIkey_name\fR \fIfile_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "a key key_name file_name"
The \fBadd key\fR command.  This command adds a named key value to the
security policy database.  The content of \fIfile_name\fR is taken as the
value of the key.  Named keys can be referenced by other elements of the
security policy database.
.IP "\fBc key\fR \fIkey_name\fR \fIfile_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "c key key_name file_name"
The \fBchange key\fR command.  This command changes the value of the named
key, obtaining the new key value from the content of \fIfile_name\fR.
.IP "\fBd key\fR \fIkey_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "d key key_name"
The \fBdelete key\fR command.  This command deletes the key identified by \fIname\fR.
.IP "\fBi key\fR \fIkey_name\fR" 4
.IX Item "i key key_name"
This command will print information about the named key, i.e., the length of
its current value.
.IP "\fBl key\fR" 4
.IX Item "l key"
This command lists all keys in the security policy database.
.IP "\fBa bspbabrule\fR \fIsender_eid_expr\fR \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR \fI{ '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }\fR" 4
.IX Item "a bspbabrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr { '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }"
The \fBadd bspbabrule\fR command.  This command adds a rule specifying the
manner in which Bundle Authentication Block (\s-1BAB\s0) validation will be applied
to all bundles sent from any node whose endpoints' IDs match
\&\fIsender_eid_expr\fR and received at any node whose endpoints' IDs
match \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.  Both \fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR
should terminate in wild-card characters, because both the security source
and security destination of a \s-1BAB\s0 are actually nodes rather than individual
endpoints.
.Sp
If a zero-length string ('') is indicated instead of a \fIciphersuite_name\fR then
\&\s-1BAB\s0 validation is disabled for this sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0 expression pair: all
bundles sent from nodes with matching administrative endpoint IDs to nodes
with matching administrative endpoint IDs will be immediately deemed authentic.
Otherwise, a bundle from a node with matching administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 to a
node with matching administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 will only be deemed authentic
if it contains a \s-1BAB\s0 computed via the ciphersuite named by \fIciphersuite_name\fR
using a key value that is identical to the current value of the key named
\&\fIkey_name\fR in the local security policy database.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR: if the security policy database contains no \s-1BAB\s0 rules at all, then
\&\s-1BAB\s0 authentication is disabled; all bundles received from all neighboring
nodes are considered authentic.  Otherwise, \s-1BAB\s0 rules \fBmust\fR be defined
for all nodes from which bundles are to be received; all bundles received
from any node for which no \s-1BAB\s0 rule is defined are considered inauthentic
and are discarded.
.IP "\fBc bspbabrule\fR \fIsender_eid_expr\fR \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR \fI{ '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }\fR" 4
.IX Item "c bspbabrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr { '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }"
The \fBchange bspbabrule\fR command.  This command changes the ciphersuite
name and/or key name for the \s-1BAB\s0 rule pertaining to the sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0
expression pair identified by \fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.
Note that the \fIeid_expr\fRs must exactly match those of the rule that is to
be modified, including any terminating wild-card character.
.IP "\fBd bspbabrule\fR \fIsender_eid_expr\fR \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR" 4
.IX Item "d bspbabrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr"
The \fBdelete bspbabrule\fR command.  This command deletes the \s-1BAB\s0 rule
pertaining to the sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0 expression pair identified by
\&\fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.  Note that the \fIeid_expr\fRs
must exactly match those of the rule that is to be deleted, including any
terminating wild-card character.
.IP "\fBi bspbabrule\fR \fIsender_eid_expr\fR \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR" 4
.IX Item "i bspbabrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr"
This command will print information (the ciphersuite and key names) about the
\&\s-1BAB\s0 rule pertaining to \fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.
.IP "\fBl bspbabrule\fR" 4
.IX Item "l bspbabrule"
This command lists all \s-1BAB\s0 rules in the security policy database.
.IP "\fBa bsppibrule\fR \fIsender_eid_expr\fR \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR \fIblock type number\fR \fI{ '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }\fR" 4
.IX Item "a bsppibrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr block type number { '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }"
The \fBadd bsppibrule\fR command.  This command adds a rule specifying the
manner in which Payload Integrity Block (\s-1PIB\s0) validation will be applied
to all bundles sent from any node whose administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 matches
\&\fIsender_eid_expr\fR and received at any node whose administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0
\&\s-1ID\s0 matches \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.
.Sp
If a zero-length string ('') is indicated instead of a \fIciphersuite_name\fR then
\&\s-1PIB\s0 validation is disabled for this sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0 expression pair: all
bundles sent from nodes with matching administrative endpoint IDs to nodes
with matching administrative endpoint IDs will be immediately deemed secure.
Otherwise, a bundle from a node with matching administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 to a
node with matching administrative endpoint \s-1ID\s0 will only be deemed secure
if it contains a \s-1PIB\s0 computed via the ciphersuite named by \fIciphersuite_name\fR
using a key value that is identical to the current value of the key named
\&\fIkey_name\fR in the local security policy database.

.IX Item "c bsppibrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr block type number { '' | ciphersuite_name key_name }"
The \fBchange bsppibrule\fR command.  This command changes the ciphersuite
name and/or key name for the \s-1PIB\s0 rule pertaining to the sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0
expression pair identified by \fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.
Note that the \fIeid_expr\fRs must exactly match those of the rule that is to
be modified, including any terminating wild-card character.

.IX Item "d bsppibrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr block type number"
The \fBdelete bsppibrule\fR command.  This command deletes the \s-1PIB\s0 rule
pertaining to the sender/receiver \s-1EID\s0 expression pair identified by
\&\fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.  Note that the \fIeid_expr\fRs
must exactly match those of the rule that is to be deleted, including any
terminating wild-card character.

.IX Item "i bsppibrule sender_eid_expr receiver_eid_expr block type number"
This command will print information (the ciphersuite and key names) about the
\&\s-1PIB\s0 rule pertaining to \fIsender_eid_expr\fR and \fIreceiver_eid_expr\fR.
.IP "\fBl bsppibrule\fR" 4
.IX Item "l bsppibrule"
This command lists all \s-1PIB\s0 rules in the security policy database.
.IP "\fBx\fR \fI[ { ~ | sender_eid_expr } [ { ~ | receiver_eid_expr} [ { ~ | bab | pib | pcb | esb } ] ] ]\fR" 4
.IX Item "x [ { ~ | sender_eid_expr } [ { ~ | receiver_eid_expr} [ { ~ | bab | pib | pcb | esb } ] ] ]"
This command will clear all rules for the indicated type of security block
between the indicated security source and security destination.  If block
type is omitted it defaults to \fB~\fR signifying \*(L"all security blocks\*(R".  If
both block type and security destination are omitted, security destination
defaults to \fB~\fR signifying \*(L"all security destinations\*(R".  If all three
command-line parameters are omitted, then security source defaults to \fB~\fR
signifying \*(L"all security sources\*(R".
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fB?\fR command.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

.IP "a key \s-1BABKEY\s0 ./babkey.txt" 4
.IX Item "a key BABKEY ./babkey.txt"
Adds a new key named \*(L"\s-1BABKEY\s0\*(R" whose value is the content of the file
\&\*(L"./babkey.txt\*(R".
.IP "a bspbabrule ipn:19.* ipn:11.* \s-1HMAC_SHA1\s0 \s-1BABKEY\s0" 4
.IX Item "a bspbabrule ipn:19.* ipn:11.* HMAC_SHA1 BABKEY"
Adds a \s-1BAB\s0 rule requiring that all bundles sent from node number 19 to node
number 11 contain Bundle Authentication Blocks computed via the \s-1HMAC_SHA1\s0
ciphersuite using a key value that is identical to the current value of the
key named \*(L"\s-1BABKEY\s0\*(R" in the local security policy database.
.IP "c bspbabrule ipn:19.* ipn:11.* ''" 4
.IX Item "c bspbabrule ipn:19.* ipn:11.* ''"
Changes the \s-1BAB\s0 rule pertaining to all bundles sent from node number 19 to
node number 11.  \s-1BAB\s0 checking is disabled; these bundles will be automatically
deemed authentic.
